                <h2>Our Meetups</h2>
                <p>The past 2 years have been the most amazing times and memories that I have spent with anyone and I would not change a single thing. Every moment with you is like a Disney movie where we magically fall in love. This website will be my gift
                    to you for 2 years of the most amazing and wonderful life I have with you. I hope to spend many more years with you. I love you so much Patricia, You Mean the World to Me. &#10084 </p>

                <h2>The Distance</h2>
                <p>Long distance relationships require a lot of trust. When we separated from each other not only from our homes but from college too was tough. It had tested our relationship and it was definitely hard. Countless nights of video calling
                    late at nights. Through the separation, I believe it made me fall in lover harder.</p>

                <h2>Our Meetups</h2>
                <p>We both knew long distance relationships were tough ones but I believe that if a person loves you, they will find a way to see you. Our summers, we tried to see each other any way we could. Even through the semesters we tried to see each
                    other. Just the sight of seeing each other warms up my heart. Each time that I see you in person, it is beautiful.</p>

                <h2>What Happened Next</h2>
                <p>At first, I did not know how to act. I really wanted this relationship to work. You brought feelings in me that I never really expressed. I fell for you so HARD, it was honestly pretty crazy. We clicked so fast and I started thinking about
                    the future. I was thinking "Is she the one?"</p>

                <h2>How It All Started</h2>
                <p>It all started with a filipino boy wanting to meet new people, especially new filipinos at college. Then one day, you came along. I had always wanted to date a filipina, and there you were. You are so beautiful even on the day that I saw
                    you the first time. The first time I saw you, OH WOW. We matched on Tinder, and I was really nervous about when you would text me back. I deleted the app and reinstalled so many times in hopes that you would respond. Next thing you
                    know, BAM. The journey continues...</p>
